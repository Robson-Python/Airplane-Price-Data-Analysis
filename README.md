Airplane Price Prediction

Project

This dataset contains 12,377 rows and is designed for machine learning models to predict airplane prices. The data simulates real-world factors that affect airplane costs, making it ideal for regression tasks, exploratory data analysis, and model training.

The purpose of this project is entirely for my training and to put my skills into practice. I will also include it in my portfolio so I can showcase my skills and win future projects and clients in the area of ​​Data Analysis and Science with Python.**
